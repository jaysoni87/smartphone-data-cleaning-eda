# Smartphone Dataset – Cleaning, EDA & Feature Engineering

## Project Overview
This project focuses on working with a **smartphone dataset containing 1000+ rows**, originally downloaded from **Kaggle**.  
The main purpose of the project is to deeply understand the dataset by performing:

- **Data Cleaning**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Feature Engineering**

The entire process ensures that the dataset is well-structured, consistent, and enriched with additional useful features.

## Tasks Performed

### ✔️ 1. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values  
- Removed duplicate entries  
- Standardized text/category formats  
- Fixed inconsistent values  
- Treated outliers (where necessary)

### ✔️ 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Univariate analysis (distribution of price, RAM, storage, battery, etc.)
- Bivariate and correlation analysis  
- Visualizations to understand patterns and smartphone characteristics  
- Identification of important trends in the market/specifications  

### ✔️ 3. Feature Engineering
- Creation of new features based on existing columns  
- Conversion of categorical fields into structured formats  
- Extraction and transformation of specification-related information  
- Feature formatting and optimization for better understanding
